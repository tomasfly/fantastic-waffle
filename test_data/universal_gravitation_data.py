# Test data for Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant in m^3 kg^−1 s^−2
m1 = 5.972e24  # Mass of Earth in kg
m2 = 7.348e22  # Mass of Moon in kg
r = 3.844e8  # Distance between Earth and Moon in meters

# Expected results
force = G * (m1 * m2) / (r ** 2)  # Gravitational force between Earth and Moon
