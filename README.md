# Physics Math Project

This project contains implementations and tests for various laws and concepts in physics and mathematics.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code files.
    - `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the `src` directory as a Python package.
    - `newtons_laws.py`: Contains the implementation of Newton's Laws of Motion.
    - `universal_gravitation.py`: Contains the implementation of Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation.
    - `simple_harmonic_motion.py`: Contains the implementation of Simple Harmonic Motion.
    - `fibonacci_sequence.py`: Contains the implementation of the Fibonacci Sequence.
    - `prime_numbers.py`: Contains the implementation of Prime Numbers.
    - `law_of_large_numbers.py`: Contains the implementation of the Law of Large Numbers.

- `tests/`: This directory contains the unit tests for the implementations.
    - `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the `tests` directory as a Python package.
